The Ensemble Vector Median Filter (EVMF) is a filtering technique designed for color image processing. It integrates multiple types of vector median filters into a single ensemble, each employing a distinct approach to removing impulsive noise. This process enhances adaptability to various image characteristics, effectively reducing noise while preserving essential details. By considering the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components, EVMF improves the quality of color images through the combined power of multiple vector median filters.
